# Prometheus Node Monitoring Setup

A hands-on project to set up **Prometheus** and monitor a Node.js application on Windows. This repository provides a ready-to-use setup for learning Prometheus installation, configuration, and monitoring metrics from a Node.js application.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

- Installing and configuring Prometheus on Windows.
- Setting up a Node.js application that exposes metrics.
- Configuring Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Node.js app.
- Basic usage of Prometheus for monitoring application performance.

The project is designed for **learning and experimentation**, and can serve as a foundation for more advanced monitoring setups, including Docker or Kubernetes integrations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhushan-yadava/Set-up-Prometheus-Install-configure-it.git
cd Set-up-Prometheus-Install-configure-it/clean-repo
Install Node.js dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd node-metrics-app
npm install
Run Node.js metrics app:

bash
Copy code
node index.js
Configure Prometheus:

Create prometheus.yml pointing to Node.js app metrics endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:3000/metrics).

Start Prometheus using your local installation.

üñ•Ô∏è Usage
Open Prometheus dashboard: http://localhost:9090/

Run queries to monitor metrics exposed by your Node.js app.

Example Prometheus query:
